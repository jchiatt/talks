# React - the longer version

- Lots of configuration over convention
- Lots of additional tools/concepts to learn in order to build a full, scalable application
  - Bundling
  - Accessibility
  - Routing
  - Performance
  - Server Side Rendering
  - Data Fetching
  - Testing
  - and more!
- Lots of "thought leaders"
- Can lead to confusion, especially for newer developers
